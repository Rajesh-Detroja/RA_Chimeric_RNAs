#### - Collection of RNAâ€“Seq data
- A total of 217 publicly available total RNA sequencing samples isolated from joint synovial biopsies were downloaded from the GEO database (GEO accession: [GSE89408](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89408))

- We also downloaded RNA-seq data from tissue samples of 122 healthy human individu-als representing 32 different tissues from EBI ArrayExpress (accession [E-MTAB-2836](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-2836/))

- All of the raw sequencing data were initially subjected to quality control analysis using [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and an in-house [bash script](https://github.com/Rajesh-Detroja/RA_Chimeric_RNAs/blob/main/fastq_stats.sh)

- Raw sequencing data was trimmed using the [cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) tool

#### - Identification of chimeric RNAs from RNA-seq data
- Chimeric RNAs using our in-house reference-based method [ChiTaH](https://github.com/Rajesh-Detroja/ChiTaH)

- Previously demonstrated to be the most efficient [reference-based tool](https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/3/4/lqab112/6441772?login=true) for chimeric RNAs detection

</br>

#### - Differential gene expression analysis
- Differential gene expression analysis of cohorts was performed using [DESeq2](https://github.com/Rajesh-Detroja/RA_Chimeric_RNAs/blob/main/DESeq2.R)

- Readcount tables used for differential gene expression analysis can be downloaded from the following links:
