#### - Collection of RNAâ€“Seq data
- A total of 217 publicly available total RNA sequencing samples isolated from joint synovial biopsies were downloaded from the GEO database (GEO accession: [GSE89408](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE89408))

- We also downloaded RNA-seq data from tissue samples of 122 healthy human individu-als representing 32 different tissues from EBI ArrayExpress (accession [E-MTAB-2836](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-2836/))

- All of the raw sequencing data were initially subjected to quality control analysis using [FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) and an in-house [bash script](https://github.com/Rajesh-Detroja/RA_Chimeric_RNAs/blob/main/fastq_stats.sh).
